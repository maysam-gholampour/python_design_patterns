<h1>Repository for Mastering Python Design Patterns: 
A guide to creating smart, efficient and resuable software
 by Kamon Ayeva and Sakis Kasampalis</h1>

This repo is almost identical to Kamon's own repo:

https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Mastering-Python-Design-Patterns-Second-Edition

But with several error fixed in his code as well as some 
implementation for his suggested improvements. Also I included some of my own practices
with design patterns. Supposed more improvement are yet to be implemented 
will have TODO notes. I followed more PEP 8 style than Kamon did.

In short. An expansion on Kamon's book which I really enjoy reading.
